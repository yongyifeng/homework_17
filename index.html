                    <p>Nice to virtually meet you!</p>
                    <p>I am a passionate, empathetic, communicative UX/UI practitioner that enjoys
                            observing, learning, creating and iterating throughout the design process.  
                            My goal is to make technology more inclusive and intuitive for all with my delicate
                            craft and strong product thinking skills. </p>
                    <p>Before getting into UX/UI,  I was in the banking industry where I learned about 
                            the ins and outs of a business, and received top-tier training from leading 
                            financial instituitions on relationship-building and communication skills. These
                            hard skills and soft skills have helped me build instant connections with users, 
                            stakeholders, and partners, as I balance user and business needs for my design works.</p>
                    <p> When I am not designing, you can find me eating, watching movies, taking pictures, 
                        hiking, reading, doing grocery shopping, gardening, cooking and 
                        mentoring youth.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for visiting. Looking forward to chatting with you! </p>
